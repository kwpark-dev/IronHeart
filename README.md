In this project, majority of modern RL approaches, especially deep learning-based, will be addressed.
The learning capability is examined in Mujoco environment using 
Hopper (3 dim'l action, 11 dim'l state), Ant (8 dim'l action, 105 dim'l state), and Humanoid (17 dim'l action, 348 dim'l state).
I'm also planning to consider images (or other sensory perception) as states for robotic applications.
